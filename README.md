Connectivity to snowpark container services

## Setup

Create an application:

```sql
DESCRIBE COMPUTE POOL tutorial_compute_pool;

DROP SERVICE IF EXISTS echo_service;

CREATE SERVICE echo_service
  IN COMPUTE POOL tutorial_compute_pool
  FROM SPECIFICATION $$
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: echo
        image: /tutorial_db/alex_test_data_schema/tutorial_repository/my_echo_service
        env:
          SERVER_PORT: 8000
          CHARACTER_NAME: Bob
        readinessProbe:
          port: 8000
          path: /healthcheck
      endpoints:
      - name: echoendpoint
        port: 8000
        public: true
      $$
   MIN_INSTANCES=1
   MAX_INSTANCES=1;
```

Ensure it's deployed

```sql
SHOW SERVICES;

SELECT SYSTEM$GET_SERVICE_STATUS('echo_service');

DESCRIBE SERVICE echo_service;
```

ðŸš¨ Get the latest endpoint URL ðŸš¨

A very important step - if you haven't redeployed and you're using your old version you might get 405 Method Not Allowed because you're not using the latest version:

```sql
SHOW ENDPOINTS IN SERVICE echo_service;
```

## Redeploying

I'm not sure if this is the right way but I couldn't find another way to take the latest container instance so just dropped it and recreated it. In the future we could probably use blue/green with a dns to route traffic so zero downtime.

```sql
DROP SERVICE IF EXISTS echo_service;

# CREATE ... (see above)
```

## Pause and resume

Should you want to for some reason pause and resume it:

```sql
ALTER SERVICE echo_service SUSPEND;

ALTER SERVICE echo_service RESUME;

SHOW ENDPOINTS IN SERVICE echo_service;
```

## Function

Should you wish to get way more advanced and make this callable in Snowflake SQL itself:

```sql
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS my_echo_udf(VARCHAR);

CREATE FUNCTION my_echo_udf (InputText varchar)
  RETURNS varchar
  SERVICE=echo_service
  ENDPOINT=echoendpoint
  AS '/echo';
SELECT my_echo_udf('hello world!');
```
